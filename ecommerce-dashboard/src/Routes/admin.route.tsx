/**
 * V1 scope only — see planning/admin_dashboard_design_plan.md §2.
 *
 * The codebase has far more pages scaffolded (Inventory/Purchases &
 * Suppliers & Warehouses, Customers/Segments, Marketing/Campaigns &
 * Promotions, Finance/*, Staff/Permissions) than V1 needs — those belong to
 * later versions and are deliberately not wired into this nav. The page
 * files still exist on disk for when their version comes up; don't delete
 * them. Staff/EmployeesPage and Staff/RolesPage ARE wired in (Administration
 * group below) — Permissions is folded into the role edit modal instead of
 * being its own page, so Staff/PermissionsPage.tsx stays unwired.
